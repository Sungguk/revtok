In 1866, the S.S. General Sherman, an ironclad schooner recommissioned for use in the China trade after service for the Union as a blockade runner in the Civil War, came sailing across the Yellow Sea and entered the mouth of the Taedong River on the west coast of the Korean peninsula. What the ship’s commander, a Captain Preston, was after—trade or spying or pillage, or all three—remains a matter of speculation. Korea, a feudal kingdom ruled according to a strictly paternalistic Confucian code, was notoriously hostile to foreigners, and with reason. While a single dynasty had held the throne for five hundred years, the country—the size of North and South Carolina combined—had been incessantly squeezed and serially invaded by bigger, more powerful neighbors. Korea was the most racially homogeneous nation in Asia, and yearned to believe that it was self-sufficient. But, although its borders were sealed, it could not fend for itself, and Korea’s kings had submitted to Chinese suzerainty, paying regular tribute to China’s emperors in the Forbidden City, in exchange for being protected and otherwise left alone. To Western traders and missionaries, encouraged by the opening of Japan in 1854, Korea’s xenophobic reputation as the last “hermit kingdom” exerted an immense temptation. Tales circulated of unseen wonders: miniature horses, giant birds, and tombs of solid gold encasing cadavers littered with precious gems. Never mind that French Jesuits who had infiltrated Korea from China had never been heard from again. Captain Preston set out to be the first American to carry his flag into Korea, and, by all accounts, he was.
As Preston and his crew (three Americans, an English missionary, and some twenty Chinese and Malay seamen) sailed up the Taedong, ignoring local demands to turn back, the Regent of Korea decreed that the invaders be driven out or killed. The battle was met not far from Pyongyang, now the capital of North Korea, where a war party had gathered on the riverbanks. The Sherman’s cannons were deadlier than the Koreans’ flaming arrows, and its armor was impervious to their heavier missiles, but the ship soon ran aground and would not come free. After four days of fighting, a Korean officer named Pak launched burning barges against its hull and set it aflame, forcing all aboard to throw themselves into the river, where they were captured by Korean fighters and either hacked to death at once or brought to shore for dismemberment by the jubilant crowds. Body parts were carried off as trophies, and Pak was acclaimed as a savior of the nation. In 1905, a Daily Mail correspondent, F. A. McKenzie, was shown the Sherman’s anchor chains hanging from the gates of Pyongyang, “as a warning to all men of the fate awaiting those who would dare to disturb the peace of the Land of the Morning Calm.”
By McKenzie’s time, however, Korea had been cracked open to the outside world—initially by diplomacy, through defensive treaties with expansive Western powers, and then by force—and the warning of the rusty chains rang with Ozymandian self-delusion. America was the first non-Asian country to win the welcome of the Korean court. In a Treaty of Amity and Commerce, signed in 1882, Washington pledged its “good offices” if Korea was threatened from abroad, and the king was said to have danced with delight when an American diplomat was posted to Seoul. Yet twenty years later President Teddy Roosevelt stood by when tsarist Russia, looking south from its booming Pacific frontier at Vladivostok, saw warm-water ports and Chinese weakness in Korea and moved troops into the peninsula. The Russians were soon driven out by imperial Japan, whose subsequent domination of Korea was brokered by Roosevelt in a deal that ultimately won him a Nobel Peace Prize. In this way, buffeted by the same foreign powers that its destiny still depends on, the antique kingdom of Korea was dragged into the twentieth century as a subject nation. When liberation came, with the Japanese surrender in the Second World War, the Soviet Union occupied the North and America the South, and, in a hasty move that was meant to be temporary, the country was cut roughly in half at the waist, along the thirty-eighth parallel.
The destruction of the Sherman might well have been forgotten were it not for official North Korean historians, who insist that the true hero of the great defense of the nation against the American imperialist buccaneers wasn’t the officer Pak but, rather, a man named Kim Ung-u, a tenant farmer who begat a son named Kim Bo-hyon, a leader of the anti-Japanese resistance, who begat a son named Kim Hyong-jik, another freedom-fighting scourge to the colonial oppressor, who begat a son named Kim Song-ju, who became a partisan leader, and—begetting himself all over again under the nom de guerre of Kim Il Sung—fulfilled his family’s destiny and the nation’s by finally driving the imperialist foe from Korea, establishing the supreme revolutionary state of North Korea and begetting a son named Yuri, who also re-begat himself, as Kim Jong Il.
These are the generations of the Kims that virtually every North Korean knows, at least sketchily. They make for a stirring tale of patriotic patrimony, yet the battlefield exploits that North Korea’s court hagiographers attribute to Kim Il Sung’s ancestors are entirely fictitious, and his own are fantastically exaggerated. In the nineteen-thirties, in Manchuria, where his father had run an herbal pharmacy, Kim Il Sung did fight as a Communist partisan, and for a time he even led his own small band of guerrillas there, distinguishing himself sufficiently to earn the highest honor from the Japanese—a price on his head. But at the outset of the Second World War he retreated to the Soviet Union, and he spent the rest of the war years at a Red Army garrison near the Siberian city of Khabarovsk, where Kim Jong Il was born (hence the Russian name, Yuri). Although North Korean historians say that it was Kim Il Sung and his fighters who defeated the Japanese, and not the Americans, he didn’t return to Korea until a month after its liberation, and he arrived in the uniform of the foreign occupier, as an officer in the Soviet Army. In fact, what is most remarkable about Kim Il Sung’s ascent to the position of absolute power which he soon enjoyed in North Korea, and which Kim Jong Il has inherited by dynastic succession, is that there was nothing about his lineage or early career that marked him for such a future when he turned up in Pyongyang in 1945. As Dae-Sook Suh, a Korean-American historian of North Korea and biographer of Kim Il Sung, observes, “Contrary to the efforts to build Kim’s image as a person coming from a long revolutionary tradition and dedicated parents, his image may be more resplendent if he is described as he was: ‘a dragon from an ordinary well,’ so to speak. At least that would be closer to the truth.”
In North Korea, however, the truth has never been a matter of fact so much as an expression of the Kims’ whim—father and son. The great preponderance of this so-called truth is a confection of outright lies—not merely false but, more perniciously, a form of unreality, imposed with such relentlessness and violence on a people hermetically sealed from any alternative sources of information that it has become their only reality. A North Korean who does not believe the state’s every claim is left with the void of dumb disbelief, for it is impossible in Kim Il Sung Nation—as the North is sometimes described in its own proclamations—to find anything else to believe in. “The people are my god,” Kim Il Sung said, but it is before his towering statues that the people bow down and weep, his name that they must not take in vain, and his teachings that they must live by—even now—lest they be destroyed.
Kim Il Sung’s formal schooling ended in the eighth grade. After that, he lived in a realm of extremity, made up in equal measures of violence and Marxist-Leninist indoctrination, and he was convinced that with the right mix of these measures one could make one’s world as one wanted it to be. It was crush or be crushed. As he consolidated his control of the ruling Korean Workers Party in the late nineteen-forties, he set about lobbying his patron, Stalin, who had by then withdrawn Soviet forces from Korea, to consent to his taking over South Korea as well. Stalin urged Kim to be patient, but eventually gave him the nod. No sooner did the North begin to pour its army into the sleeping South, shortly before dawn on June 25, 1950, than Kim Il Sung proclaimed that the opposite had happened: America and its South Korean puppets had invaded, necessitating defensive action. Or, as the Party History Institute of the Central Committee put it, “Comrade Kim Il Sung, the ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, military strategic genius,” went on the radio and called upon the Korean people “to rise as one in the sacred struggle for wiping out the U.S. imperialist armed invaders and their stooges.”
The North overran the South until America mustered a United Nations mandate to repel the aggression and drove the People’s Army back, overrunning the North all the way to the Chinese frontier, at which point Mao sent a million “volunteers” into the fight, and Stalin dispatched his air force and told Kim, who was ready to give up and sue for peace, to keep fighting. Three years and as many as three million war deaths later, Korea was right where it began: split along the thirty-eighth parallel. A cease-fire was signed, and a two-and-a-half-mile-wide demilitarized zone was carved across the peninsula along the line of partition. But there was no formal peace treaty. The Korean War had no winner, and fifty years later it is still not over.
Kim Il Sung declared victory nonetheless, and boasted of “inflicting an ignominious defeat on U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.” That was the line: North Korea had smashed the foreign invaders, killing three hundred and ninety-seven thousand American troops in the war (the actual number was thirty-six thousand), and, what was more, it had done so entirely on its own, “under the correct leadership.” The war was, in fact, a considerable victory for Kim Il Sung, but only domestically, insofar as it provided him with a pretext for tightening his control of the Party and the Party’s control of every aspect of his subjects’ existence. Throughout the nineteen-fifties, in purge after purge, people accused of harboring even a flicker of “anti-Party, counter-revolutionary” disloyalty risked being killed, or imprisoned (usually with their families) in labor camps from which most did not return.
It was Hitler who remarked that the masses “will more easily fall victim to a big lie than a small one.” The supreme fiction of North Korean propaganda, to which all other mystifications must conform, is the Kim dynasty’s account of the Korean War: attacked, defended, triumphant, unassisted. Surely, enough North Koreans saw enough of the war to know that it wasn’t so. Their young men had rolled into the South virtually unresisted, Seoul was captured in three days, then the Chinese were everywhere, Russian MiGs and their pilots had fallen from the sky, and exactly what had been attained? But who would risk being crushed to speak such memories?
“My husband told me that Seoul was empty when he marched through, and he thought that was strange because he thought the U.S. and South Korea started the war,” Lee Young-suk, a former North Korean nurse who escaped to China during the great famine of the nineteen-nineties, told me in Seoul. “Even though he was in the military he believed that.” Lee had reached the South after a grim ordeal as an illegal asylum seeker in China. At one point, her whole family had been arrested and handed back across the border to North Korean security agents, who singled her out for abuse because she was carrying a Bible. She had bribed her way out again with the rings from her fingers. Lee was small and strong, and her hands, which were in constant motion when she talked, were heavily stacked with gold rings—as a reminder and for security, should she find herself in such a fix again.
Although Seoul is just thirty miles from the DMZ, Lee finds it bewilderingly unfamiliar—hyper-modern, a sprawling megalopolis of more than ten million people (close to half the population of the North), a gray and hazy place of blinking neon reflecting dully off façades of steel and glass, an engine of wealth, churning with commerce and high-tech gadgetry, where children chatter on cell phones in the subway, where more homes have broadband Internet service than anywhere else on earth, where you can say and hear and see and do and buy pretty much anything and everything you please. As a defector, one of just three thousand North Koreans to have reached the South out of hundreds of thousands who escaped to China, Lee had been given her apartment in Seoul by the government, a tiny one-bedroom in a poured-concrete apartment block, where she lives with her seven-year-old granddaughter. Although the furniture was cheap and mostly secondhand—a fact she’d tried to disguise by draping it with lace—she could not get over the ease and abundance she had found in her old age. “I have everything,” she said. But when she recalled her life in North Korea her voice carried the anger of someone who has been robbed of everything.
Lee is sixty-seven years old. She had been a Party member since she was a girl, and her husband had retired from the Army in the early nineties as a high-ranking officer. Yet it was only when they reached China that they learned that the Korean War had been Kim Il Sung’s idea. “Our hearts broke when we realized we had given our lives to a lie,” Lee said. “Even until we crossed the border we kept our Party badges on, because we wanted to serve the Party.” Still, Lee hadn’t found it easy to let go of her beliefs. “I hated Americans, because of all that indoctrination in the North,” she said, and she had been frightened, in China, when her husband fell ill and some Americans turned up with medicine. “Invaders,” she had thought,“total villains.” But, she said, “it wasn’t true. They helped us a lot.” Lee had found solace in Christianity. Her apartment was cluttered with votive objects, and when she said, “I believed in the regime as if it had been a god,” she extended her hand toward a large poster of Jesus that hung over her bed.
Most modern dictators have been self-made men, and it is the particular affliction of North Korea that Kim Il Sung was a self-made deity. In his lifetime, state propaganda spoke of him as incomparable, omnipotent, and infallible—“the Clairvoyant,” Korea’s “sun,” “the perfect brain,” capable even of determining the weather (at least when it was good)—and in 1998, four years after his death, the constitution was revised to install him as “president for eternity.” His son, Kim Jong Il, rules as much as a caretaker as he does as an heir; he is described merely as the “central brain,” and “the morning star,” a lesser light reflecting the sun’s glow. In the early seventies, the North Korean Academy of Social Sciences expunged the definition of hereditary rule from its Dictionary of Political Terminologies—“a reactionary custom of exploitative societies,” “originally a product of slave societies,” “later adopted by feudal lords as a means to perpetuate dictatorial rule.” Yet even after he was publicly anointed successor to his father’s throne, in 1980, Kim Jong Il kept a low profile, tucked away in the regime’s secret nerve centers, the Department of Propaganda and Agitation and the Department of Organization and Guidance. Confucius said, “When your father is alive, observe his will. When your father is dead, observe his former actions. If for three years you do not change from the ways of your father, you can be called a ‘real son.’ ” The junior Kim earned that title. “Expect no change from me,” he said after the Great Leader died, and for once he has kept his word.
Kim Jong Il says that he regards “the people” as “the most beautiful and excellent beings in the world and deeply worships them.” But he doesn’t trust them; his adoration, like a jealous lover’s, is only rhetorically distinguishable from contempt. To maintain a kingdom of lies is to live in perpetual fear of being exposed, and the Pyongyang regime considers its insularity its proudest accomplishment, the key to its survival, and proof, as Kim Jong Il has said, that “we have nothing to envy the rest of the world.” Indeed, despite the heavy doses of Stalinist and Maoist jargon in its economic policies and Party doctrine, to speak of North Korea under the Kim dynasty simply as a Communist state is insufficient. In recent decades, references to Marxism-Leninism have steadily faded from its propaganda. Marx and Lenin were not Korean, and North Korea’s ruling ideology—Juche, which means self-reliance or self-mastery—is predicated on being independent from the claims or destinies of other revolutions.
In its most obvious form, the Juche idea is a claim of radical autonomy: absolute political and economic independence for the Korean nation without any desire or need for traffic of any kind with other peoples. Kim Il Sung first promulgated this inward-turning, nativist ideology in 1955, when he officially distanced North Korea from Soviet patronage. The Kremlin regarded him as a canny ingrate. After all, with tens of thousands of American troops now perched on permanent high alert across the DMZ, there was no gainsaying North Korea’s strategic significance as a Cold War buffer state, and no question that, despite Kim’s posturing, he would retain the vital support of Moscow and Beijing. Yet, even as North Korea grew ever more indebted to its Communist trading partners, the separatist teachings of Juche developed into Pyongyang’s paramount doctrine, and the idea came to stand for something more grandiose and more inchoate than it had at first appeared. Juche is, finally, the religion of the Kim dynasty—a syncretic concoction of socialist theory, militarism, Confucianism, shamanism, and the cult of personality—and it purports to carry the mystical power of revelation. (In 1997, Pyongyang officially withdrew from Christian time and placed North Korea on a Juche calendar, which marks the beginning of history as 1912, the year of Kim Il Sung’s birth.)
A vast quantity of largely incoherent prose attempting to explain Juche has been written in North Korea, but the effort collapses beneath its own weight. Even Bruce Cumings, the American scholar of Korean history and thought who has entered most deeply into Koreans’ self-perceptions, throws up his hands. “The term is really untranslatable; the closer one gets to its meaning, the more the meaning slips away,” he writes in “Korea’s Place in the Sun.” “For a foreigner its meaning recedes into a pool of everything that makes Koreans Korean, and therefore it is ultimately inaccessible to the non-Korean. Juche is the opaque core of North Korean national solipsism.”
Nowhere has Pyongyang’s mythology of self-sufficiency been so painfully laid bare as in the record of the state’s economic devastation since the disappearance of the Soviet empire. In the mid-fifties, when Juche was introduced, North Korea, which had been the center of industrial development under the Japanese, was more prosperous than the predominantly agrarian South. But by 1970 the balance had shifted. Since then, the South’s economy has grown to become the twelfth largest on earth, while the North’s steadily declined and is now estimated to rank somewhere below Burundi’s. The North devoted the bulk of its limited resources to outdated heavy industry and military expenditures, imposing one antiquated Stalinist economic plan after another with such a radical disregard for markets that it became dependent on Soviet largesse to feed its people and supply its fuel. Then, suddenly, in 1991, there was no Soviet Union, and although China took up some of the slack, North Koreans discovered that self-reliance meant hunger, cold, and darkness.
In his later years, Kim Il Sung built a medical institute in Pyongyang for the sole purpose of prolonging his life. There, surrounded by Western doctors and an army of nutritionists, masseurs, homeopaths, and the like, he was fed a diet of foods grown just for him, and a specially designed high-tech toilet analyzed his droppings. Meanwhile, across the countryside, his unaccountable scheme for bolstering the food supply by growing corn on the terraced slopes of vertiginous valleys was ending in catastrophe, as heavy rains washed the efforts away, clogging streams and rivers with silt, which in turn triggered flooding that wiped out perfectly good croplands. Industry was grinding to a halt, reduced to less than half its production capacity by lack of fuel and raw materials.
The news of Kim Il Sung’s death in 1994 was greeted by wild public mourning—seas of gaunt people in coarse cotton clothing and little caps, their hard faces riven by grief and streaming with tears. The soundtrack on the film clips is otherworldly, a deep owlish moaning. The intensity of this grief is made all the more haunting by the knowledge that Kim Il Sung had left his people destitute. “The government rationing system came to shrink steadily after 1994, and people began to die of hunger in 1995,” Kim Chol, a North Korean defector I met in Seoul, said to me. “At first, they would give fifteen days’ food for a month. Then, after several months, they went to ten days for several months. And the rationing wasn’t even steady—it went on and off and people waited and waited.”
Kim Chol is a university student, slight and slender, with bristling hair and gold spectacles. He speaks softly, in a measured monotone. But there was no mistaking his intensity as he shut his eyes and recalled, in language strikingly similar to Lee Young-suk’s, his parents’ sense that they had been betrayed by their god in the early nineties, when, as Party loyalists, they were granted permission to visit relatives in an ethnic-Korean enclave just across the frontier in northeast China. They returned in “total shock” with news that the North was to blame for Korea’s division, and that “Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il governed for themselves and not for the good of the country and its people.” Kim’s father worked as a novelist at the steel mill in Chongjin, where he was required, under the supervision of a section of the Department of Propaganda and Agitation, to spend his days producing volume after volume of stories about the lives of factory workers. “It was a respected job, but not well paid,” Kim said. Because a writer is considered not an artist but a laborer, the family had been rewarded with a housing assignment in the best apartment building in the city—a place reserved for élite steel workers—“specifically built to show Kim Il Sung, to reassure him that all North Korean people were living well.” The apartment had two rooms and a small balcony, cold running water, and electricity, but no heat in winter. Kim lived there with his parents and three older sisters for twenty years.
Normally, one had to go to Pyongyang to see apartments of such high quality. Pyongyang is North Korea’s model city, full of model schools and model hospitals and model people: residence is reserved for the Party’s chosen, the political and military élite, the commissars and cadres and their most faithful followers, and the population is regularly cleansed of those deemed ideologically lax, as well as the old, the sick, the disfigured, and the lame, who are banished to the provinces and replaced by a fresh crop of loyalists. It is a city of megalomaniacal architecture and public spaces: immense palaces and coliseums, grandiose boulevards (six, eight, ten lanes wide), towering monuments to the Great Leader, meandering greenways, prim topiary gardens, and skyscrapers (although the tallest is a shell, abandoned as structurally unusable during its construction). It is a city built to awe the rare emissaries from the outside world who are granted visas, and to glorify the Leader, who shuttles between his lavish palaces, unseen, in a darkened car that speeds down streets cleared for his passage.
Kim Chol had no complaints as a child, at the People’s Elementary School, where every pupil was drilled in air-raid procedure and taught to march. “I was satisfied with everything until I graduated from secondary school,” he said. “Everything was O.K.—not great, but security was provided for.” Then his parents came back from their fateful trip to China and took him aside, and everything wasn’t O.K. anymore. It wasn’t only a question of the war, and the self-serving leadership, Kim Chol said. “I also learned that in China people were living well and that South Korea was very rich, while North Korea was very poor.” His parents didn’t tell his sisters these things. To speak such truths to too many people, no matter how close, was “suicide.”
Every North Korean is kept track of through a registry in Pyongyang that divides the population—nearly twenty-three million souls—into three groups. At the top is the “core class” of Party members, the political and military élite who enjoy preference in education, employment, and virtually all other social and economic benefits, including food, clothing, and shelter; in the middle are the masses, the “wavering class,” composed of the peasants and workers who are tirelessly extolled in Party rhetoric but whose ration cards, before the famine, allowed them only dog meat when the core class got pork or beef; on the bottom is the “impure” or “hostile class,” in which the ideologically unsound—members of the pre-revolutionary “exploiting class,” former landowners, businessmen, pro-Japanese colonial collaborators, and people with family members who have defected to the South—are lumped together with the physically handicapped and common criminals. The core and impure classes count for about a quarter of the population each, the wavering class for the rest. At least until the early nineties, when this system began to break down, along with the economy, there were fifty-one subclasses, to which people were assigned based on a regular review and more refined analysis of their Party loyalty and ideological comportment in public and private life.
To insure that North Koreans know they are being watched without knowing by whom, the state maintains three separate internal security forces, which report to the leadership but not to one another; in addition, people who work together are usually assigned to live together in the same housing blocks, and to take part in nearly daily indoctrination and self-criticism sessions, from which nobody in North Korea except the Leader is exempt. Underpinning this whole apparatus—the most invasive and pervasive scheme for creating a monolithic culture in history—is a principle of collective family responsibility that makes every member of a household accountable for the conduct of his immediate kin, so that the deviations of one are the calamity of all. “The government doesn’t just put one or two people in jail—it puts all the family in jail, wiping everybody out, the innocent along with the guilty, as the broom wipes out the dirt,” said a defector who called himself Chang Chol-woo—an alias, assumed because he didn’t want to bring trouble on his family in the North. Who, in such an order, could dare to speak, or even know, his own mind?
It’s an old story—how, in the name of creating a classless society, Communist regimes have instead created new categories of social and political stratification and exclusion as rigid and crushingly unjust as India’s caste system or South African apartheid. But in the catalogue of atrocities and insult that have defined totalitarian states founded in the name of Marxism and Leninism, the crimes of North Korea stand out as the most unyielding and unrelieved expression of what can only be called savage Communism since the Khmer Rouge was driven from Cambodia. There is no saying how many North Koreans have been purged over the years, but the exact number—however staggering—is almost beside the point. While defectors tend to speak of the camps, from experience or hearsay or lifelong dread, as “worse than death,” the difference between being imprisoned and being free in North Korea is more one of degree than of kind. The entire place functions as a concentration camp, designed not only to keep its inmates captive but, equally, to keep the rest of the world out.
In East Germany before the Communist collapse, a zone where topography prevented the penetration of radio and television signals from the West was known as a “valley where they have no idea.” All of North Korea is such a zone, not because of its mountainous landscape but because every radio and TV set is made to receive only one signal, Pyongyang’s propaganda channel, which carries such messages as “Today, the world’s people are consistently envious of our people, calling our people the people blessed with the leader.” Kim Chol told me that his parents brought a radio back from China. “At the border, they cut the wires so it would only get North Korean broadcasting,” he said. “But I was studying electronics, and I reconnected it and began listening to South Korean radio at night under the covers.”
Although Kim no longer believed North Korean propaganda, he had been so deeply formed by it that he found the news from South Korea equally suspect. Listening to his hot-wired radio was a crime that could have landed his whole family in the camps, and he still didn’t know how to determine what was real. “I believed my parents,” he said, “but when I heard Seoul saying that one car company was producing a hundred new taxis I didn’t believe it, because that meant there were taxis in South Korea, and for that South Korea had to be very very rich.” Then again, when he saw clips on North Korean state television of violent student demonstrations in South Korea, he couldn’t avoid the impression that South Korea looked better off. “I would observe the clothes and the apartments in the background, and the clothes and houses were neat and great,” Kim said. Evidently, he wasn’t the only one who’d noticed. “Later, the North Korean broadcasters made the pictures blurry,” he said. “So you couldn’t see the details, only the street fighting.”
One of Kim Jong Il’s first policy initiatives after his father’s death in 1994 was to call on the United Nations’ World Food Program for help in feeding North Korea’s famished population. At first, this request, which amounted to an admission of the state’s destitution, was seen as an astonishing softening of the Juche line. The sort of international assistance that would be required to compensate for the nearly fifty-per-cent food deficit in North Korea always comes with conditions from donors—freedom of movement and control of distribution—and creates pressure for political and economic reform on the recipient. But it quickly became clear that Kim Jong Il was not prepared to expose his country to the scrutiny of foreign agents just to keep the people from starving to death. On the contrary, the regime, having declared itself in need, appeared bent on preventing anyone from seeing the extent of the famine. The few, individually vetted foreign aid workers who received visas were mostly kept penned up in Pyongyang and allowed to visit rural areas only under the strict control of government handlers. What they saw on these guided tours perplexed them. Andrew Natsios, who is currently the head of usaid, was in North Korea at the time as an officer of the humanitarian organization World Vision, and he describes the problem in his book, “The Great North Korean Famine”:
Before expatriate relief workers entered a city or rural area to do their work, the local authorities swept the streets of any evidence of famine. Beggars, emaciated people, abandoned children, trash or debris, and dead bodies were removed from the streets. People were told to stay indoors if they did not have presentable clothing to wear. One relief worker who spoke Korean watched a truck drive through a village just before the arrival of a visiting NGO [non-governmental organization] delegation, announcing over a loudspeaker that people should get off the streets. Only party members were permitted outside their homes to take their ration of food aid while the NGO food monitors were in the city. Put simply, the authorities had created one giant Potemkin village, designed to impress visitors but bearing little resemblance to the dark reality facing the population.
It was only as increasing numbers of North Koreans began crossing the shallow—and for a good part of the year frozen—Tumen River into China, and talking to foreign journalists and aid workers there, that this masquerade began to be understood. The escapees described the North Korea that foreigners never saw as a wasteland, its factories shuttered, its tractors and trucks running on wood-burning steam engines, its once efficient food-rationing system defunct, whole villages standing empty—mass graves here, bodies lying uncollected there, and scavenging bands of skeletal orphans roving everywhere, gnawing on bark and leaves. Those who made it to China tended to come in tattered clothing, with pathetic shoes, or shoeless, with their feet wrapped in rags; few had much flesh on their bones, and their skin and hair was often blanched by malnutrition. Lee Young-suk, the former nurse, showed me pictures of herself and her husband, the retired Army officer, on the day they arrived in China; they were small people to begin with, and in the photos, seated beside a roly-poly Chinese priest who had given them shelter, they looked so shrunken they might have been mistaken for a child’s toys.**{: .break three}
“At first, we didn’t intend to come, because all our family were Party members, so we were a well-off family,” Lee said. “But after Kim Il Sung’s death our financial situation got very much worse.” Her husband had no pension, there were no rations, and they had stripped their house bare bartering all their belongings for food. “Even though we were retired and starving, we had to work for the Party. They called it social projects, working two hours for no pay at such things as early-morning indoctrination meetings and making fertilizer. But we didn’t have much strength.” Her husband was furious when Lee first suggested going to China for rice. “But our eldest son had already gone to China, and a state security agent came looking for him. We lied, but they kept coming and asking. So one day my husband said this was getting dangerous and they could send us to prison. We ran away in August of 1997, crossed the Tumen River and went to a church there. They welcomed us.”
Lee became agitated as she spoke; she sat on the floor of her tiny bedroom in Seoul with her legs tucked under her, and she began to cry, quietly—almost, it seemed, ineptly, as if she didn’t know how to cry, and disapproved of crying, and at the same time could not cry enough. “My son who was shot to death in the military—his officer ordered him to steal pigs,” she said. “So he got angry and said, ‘I came to the military for my country’s unification and for killing Americans, not to become a thief.’ They started to fight, and the officer knocked him down and shot him dead.” She said it made her ill for days on end to think of her past, and the children and grandchildren she had lost. Then, just as abruptly, she stopped crying. “I want to tell you about the deaths of my grandchildren,” she said. “We used to eat grass soup with grass powder and my grandchild asked for rice. I told her we couldn’t have rice because we had to starve for ten days. Whenever I eat rice in South Korea, I feel very sad.”
Lee’s hands caught each other midair, and settled for a moment in her lap. “Before I found God, I drank a lot, and I drank a lot of liquor in front of the graves of my children. I want to tear Kim Jong Il to death—tear him to death. My oldest son’s wife and two of their children died of hunger. Their father had been working at a chemical-weapons factory, and they were starving. Two grandsons were starving—eight and ten years old. They went to a noodle seller, and begged. The noodle seller gave them some noodles. They ate and fell asleep on the shop floor. Then the owner killed them with an axe to put their meat into the noodles because pork was very expensive at the time.”
Refugees’ stories are often treated with suspicion as a source of reliable information on the places they’ve fled. Desperate people, who have proved willing to risk just about everything to get out, may have reason to exaggerate, or to tell you what they think you want to hear, or to be pushing the agenda of one or another political faction to which they belong. But in the late nineties, as the number of malnourished North Koreans in northeast China swelled from the thousands to the tens of thousands and into the hundreds of thousands, their accounts of the conditions that had driven them to risk their lives and escape had a cumulative authority that defied disbelief. They came from every rank of society, they had no political program, they were in no way organized, they expected nothing for their woes. Their most pressing agenda was to get some rice. What’s more, the fact that they were there—that so many had got out—was, in itself, evidence of a radical breakdown inside North Korea.
Many of the refugees had crossed the river in broad daylight, seemingly in plain view of guards who were too weak with cold and hunger either to notice or to care. The situation on the border was constantly changing. The same guards who were nowhere to be seen one day were out hunting the next, often crossing into China to round up escapees, sometimes piercing their hands or noses to string them together and march them home. Those who were captured frequently escaped again, returning to China with the bruises and scars of prison beatings. It is a measure of what things are like in North Korea that those who have escaped invariably speak of their first impression of the peasant villages and factory towns of China’s rough and underdeveloped northeast with a continuing sense of astonishment that just across a fifty-metre-wide river people could be living in such extraordinary wealth, with all modern comforts, and such freedom.
It is estimated that starvation has killed between two and three million North Koreans in the past decade—a tenth of the population—and has so stunted the generation of children who have survived that they may be considered full-grown if the tops of their heads reach the bottoms of their parents’ noses. When foreign governments and international organizations demanded greater transparency in exchange for food, Kim Jong Il warned that “imperialist ‘aid’ is a noose of plunder and subjugation, aimed at robbing ten and even a hundred things for one thing that is given.” Many megatons of food aid did get through the stonewalling and doublespeak, and lives were saved by it. But by all accounts the bulk of it was hijacked by the state to keep the Party élite and especially the military fed and faithful, and what remained for the masses tended to be reserved for urban centers and handed out or withheld as a reward or punishment for individual recipients’ perceived loyalty to the regime.
As more factories fell idle and were stripped down and carted off in their entirety, or as scrap, to be traded for food in China, Kim Jong Il cranked up the only non-military machinery he had left—ideology, propaganda, the engines of Juche. True revolutionaries, the Party newspaper explained, “sacrifice themselves on the glorious road of revolution with a clean revolutionary conscience because they also firmly believe that the revolutionary cause led by their leader is most just.” But the passion North Koreans felt for Kim Il Sung, which was genuine, however misplaced and deluded, does not appear to have been transferred to Kim Jong Il, who is remote and secretive and lacks his father’s populist touch. He has only once spoken before the general public, at a military parade in 1992, when he was heard to blurt out, “Glory to the heroic Korean People’s Army.”
Each of North Korea’s slogan campaigns in the famine years of the late nineties, which have been chronicled by Kongdan Oh and Ralph C. Hassig in “North Korea Through the Looking Glass,” was more sinister than the last. At first, North Koreans were told to draw on their “inner resources,” an idea whose vagueness was only underscored by its elaboration: “The reserves for production growth are in the heads of the people. When functionaries and working people are motivated to generate new ideas, reserves will emerge from here and there as a matter of course, and the work of exploring and enlisting reserves could take firm root as people’s own work.” But apparently no new ideas came forth, and the talk from Pyongyang turned to tightening the belt for an “arduous march,” then a “forced march to final victory,” and finally a “march to paradise.” Party operatives were called upon to “lead a more cultured and aesthetic life” by cleaning up homes and workplaces, so as to “make the whole society be firmly dominated by a merry and lively atmosphere to suit the demands of the realities of the new age of the Juche-oriented revolution we are in.” When that failed, the people were encouraged to forget the present and look to eternity: “Living today for tomorrow,” the message went, and “The more our generations undergo sufferings and shed sweat, the happier our future generations will be.” Finally, as the famine peaked just before the turn of the century, apocalypse was celebrated as a desirable revolutionary end in itself: “The spirit of suicidal explosion can be cherished only by those who thoroughly resolve to voluntarily choose death for the sake of the Party and the leader.”
The horrible weirdness of North Korea makes the place easier to parody than to make sense of, and it is folly to make too much sense of it. (Who can forget the cover of _The Economist that carried a picture of a waving Kim Jong Il under the headline “Greetings, earthlings”?) For anyone not in their thrall or under their thumb, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il appear so monstrous and so aberrant that it is almost an insult to reason to acknowledge that their primitive, impoverished ideology is not an expression of madness. But the truth is scarier: from within the narrow parameters of its own fanatical self-interest—and notwithstanding its lying, its wildness, its imprudence, its cruelty, its capriciousness, its paranoia, its messianic pretensions, and its desperation—the Pyongyang regime behaves rationally. Kim Jong Il’s purpose as a ruler is to sustain his power by any and all means, and whether he believes his own propaganda is, at this point, irrelevant.
Never has such a small, economically weak state succeeded in making such a big deal of itself for so long. That North Korea has done so is a consequence of the fact that, while Pyongyang demands that others leave it alone, it has never seen fit to return the favor. From behind its barbed wire, North Korea has been on a constant war footing for fifty years, maintaining one of the biggest armies on earth, with a million battle-ready men and the largest special-ops force anywhere, a hundred thousand strong. Since the Korean War, the North has repeatedly gone on the attack: kidnapping Japanese and South Korean citizens; digging tunnels through the bedrock below the DMZ into South Korea, tunnels big enough for an invasion force to pass through at a rate of ten soldiers a minute; sending an assassination team to Seoul to kill the President; bludgeoning to death with axes two American officers in the Joint Security Area of the DMZ; blowing up and killing seven senior members of a South Korean delegation to Burma (four cabinet members, two top Presidential advisers, and an ambassador); initiating countless naval battles with Southern ships, resulting in numerous fatalities; sending a submarine to land commandos in the South; launching a missile over Japan. The list goes on.
While the vast majority of these attacks have been aimed at South Korea, the chief target of Pyongyang’s verbal assaults over the same half century has been the United States, the archenemy, and in the North’s propaganda it is Washington that is perpetually on the offensive. Even the mildest statements of Yankee disdain for the Kim dynasty are treated as acts of aggression, tantamount to declarations of imminent invasion. Of course, to be forever at war with such a powerful foe makes a small country feel bigger. And the febrile intensity of the Kims’ anti-American harangues has had a galvanic effect on North Koreans. In a typical outburst, in 1968, Kim Il Sung declared, “The peoples of all countries making revolution should tear limbs off the U.S. beast and behead it all over the world. The U.S. imperialists appear to be strong, but when the peoples of many countries attack them from all sides and join in mutilating them in that way, they will become impotent and bite the dust in the end.” Lately, Kim Jong Il has taken to issuing threats about bathing America in a sea of fire.
North Korea is a desperado in the international arena, holed up in its enclave and taunting its enemies to come and get it. Kim Jong Il runs the place as a criminal syndicate, maintaining his kingdom with money earned primarily from arms trading, drug running, money-counterfeiting, and foreign aid. He spends the money on his own pleasures—lavish feasts, flocks of dancing girls, barrels of fine wines and spirits, fleets of black Mercedes-Benz sedans to dole out as gifts—and on the People’s Army. The only thing the country still produces that has much export value is weaponry. A recently published National Geographic map of North Korea shows ten missile facilities, home to an impressive assortment of scuds and short-range and medium-range missiles. The Pentagon believes that a long-range missile is in the works, capable of carrying a warhead of several hundred pounds to Hawaii or Alaska, and a lighter payload to the Western half of the lower forty-eight. These missiles are for sale to anyone who cares to buy them, and selling them to other governments is perfectly legal, as the Bush Administration was reminded after it was obliged earlier this year to allow an intercepted shipment of North Korean scuds bound for Yemen to continue on its way. The Federation of American Scientists has warned of Pyongyang’s capacity to produce “quantities of nerve, blister, choking and blood chemical agents,” and the National Geographic map identifies eight chemical-weapons facilities above the thirty-eighth parallel.
The North has been seeking nuclear weapons for at least forty years, and has had a nuclear-weapons program since the late seventies. In 1985, Pyongyang signed on to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which allows it to acquire nuclear reactors for energy production. It wasn’t until 1992, however, that the North agreed to grant the I.A.E.A., the International Atomic Energy Agency, access to its plutonium-production reactors. The inspectors soon noticed discrepancies in Pyongyang’s accounting of its reprocessing activities. The C.I.A. estimated that enough plutonium was missing to make an atomic bomb or two, and it has assumed ever since that North Korea has the bomb, though not yet the missile capability to deliver a nuclear warhead. That assumption is now widely shared, despite the general propensity to describe Kim Jong Il as seeking—rather than already having—a nuclear arsenal. This rhetorical ambiguity reflects how little anybody knows about what Kim Jong Il is up to—anybody, that is, except the Central Brain himself, who has so far exploited the North’s secrecy to keep the outside world uncertain and off kilter while he stage-manages the crises he creates.
In Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,” the fundamental principle of Cold War strategy is articulated by Dr. Strangelove in a spasm of sublime indignation: “The whole point of the Doomsday Machine is lost if you keep it a secret.” It would be fanciful to suggest that Pyongyang wanted the I.A.E.A. to discover its missing plutonium, but once the North’s capacity to make atomic bombs was revealed and Washington responded with alarm, Kim Jong Il—already the master of Pyongyang’s ceremonies as his father neared death—grasped the tremendous international leverage that the mystery of his nuclear capability gave him at the moment of the North’s greatest historical weakness. The incoming Clinton Administration could only speculate about whether the North had the bomb, was on the brink of getting it, or was merely bluffing. Then, in the spring of 1993, when America revived joint military exercises and war games with the South Korean Army—an annual drill called Team Spirit, which had been briefly suspended as a good-will gesture toward the North—Pyongyang threatened to gin up its own war machine and pull out of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
There were murmurs in Washington about preëmptive strikes against North Korea’s nuclear reactors, but Clinton dispatched negotiators instead. Nukes or no nukes, Kim Jong Il’s true power of deterrence resides, as it has since the Korean War, in his conventional arsenal—above all, the eleven thousand artillery pieces that are dug into underground bunkers along the edge of the DMZ and aimed at South Korea, many of them within striking distance of downtown Seoul. It is possible that an attack could strike the South’s nuclear power plants, creating an instant dirty bomb.
In 1994, Pyongyang signed a pact with Washington to remain engaged in negotiations. The Agreed Framework, as it is known, was based on the diplomatic conceit that the North’s nuclear program had never had military purposes but was intended merely for generating energy. Pyongyang pledged to freeze, and ultimately dismantle, its plutonium-production reactors, and to place these facilities under I.A.E.A. supervision. Washington promised to supply half a million barrels a year of heavy fuel oil for generating heat and electricity until a couple of energy-producing reactors, to be supplied by South Korea and Japan, were up and running. Economic and diplomatic relations were also supposed to be normalized, but, as Wendy Sherman, who was a special adviser on North Korea to President Clinton, recalls, the feeling in Washington was that the Agreed Framework was just a stopgap measure, pending “fundamental change” in North Korea. “Everyone was so overwhelmed that a million or two million people were dying of starvation, the economy had clearly collapsed, the dynamics were changing,” she said, adding, “We just thought all of that would bring about the collapse of the North Korean government within two or three years. I think that was the conventional wisdom, and we were totally wrong.”
Seven years after the Agreed Framework was signed, the new Bush Administration essentially abandoned negotiations with Korea without proposing an alternative policy. The Agreed Framework was all but scrapped. (The promise of nuclear reactors and diplomatic ties had never been fulfilled anyway.) American officials said that they would not give in to “nuclear blackmail” or “reward bad behavior.” Early last year, as Bush was making the case for the “war on terror,” he included North Korea in his State of the Union address as one of the troika of states, along with Iraq and Iran, that “constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world.” Kim Jong Il responded as if Bush had declared war, which was not so far-fetched in the climate of the moment. North Korea’s state news agency dubbed America the “empire of the devil,” and demanded a retraction.
A period of talking trash ensued. Bush told a group of senators that Kim Jong Il is a “pygmy” who acts like “a spoiled child at a dinner table” and is “starving his own people” in “a Gulag the size of Houston.” Kim’s phrasemakers responded in kind, and Korea hands and editorialists the world over lamented that Bush had lost Korea through recklessness in a time of danger. Then, last fall, when the Bush Administration was mobilizing military and diplomatic resources in preparation for war in Iraq, Pyongyang acknowledged that it hadn’t halted its nuclear-weapons program after all: a project to produce highly enriched uranium had been under way since 1998. Although Washington promptly cut off heavy-fuel shipments to the North, its response to this unwelcome distraction from Iraq was little more than a shrug. North Korea, however, was determined not to be ignored. In short order, it threw out the I.A.E.A. inspectors, shut down their monitoring cameras, withdrew from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and declared that it was reprocessing the contents of some eight thousand spent fuel rods from its formerly frozen reactors. If that’s true, the North now has the plutonium necessary to manufacture—for sale, or for use—half a dozen atomic bombs in the coming months.
Wendy Sherman said that she wasn’t shocked to find out that Kim Jong Il had been cheating. “I never trusted the North Koreans,” she told me. “I don’t think one ever negotiates with them on the basis of trust. One negotiates with them on the basis of verifiable step-by-step processes where you know what you’re getting and your expectations are relatively low over time.” In fact, she said, “I would expect them to continue to cheat, because they’re in a really bad place.” But Sherman didn’t see that as a reason not to negotiate. “Did the Soviet Union cheat? Yeah. Did the Soviet Union think we cheated? Yeah. Are arms-control agreements perfect? No. The question is managing the risks—whether in fact the agreement gets you more than you’ve lost, and it’s always a tough choice.”
Throughout last winter and this spring, Kim Jong Il once again sought to shape the agenda, demanding a non-aggression pact with Washington as the only possible solution to the nuclear crisis. The Americans refused, insisting that there was nothing to talk about until North Korea gave up its nuclear ambitions, and that nuclear proliferation was not merely Washington’s problem but a threat to all the Northeast Asian countries. There was increasing talk in Tokyo of the need for a nuclear deterrent to maintain balance in the neighborhood, and the possibility of a militarily resurgent Japan and a broader regional arms race was worrying to China, Russia, and South Korea. Beijing took the initiative, in April, hosting American and North Korean diplomats for a few days of talks. Washington touted North Korea’s participation in a multilateral process as evidence that it had been chastened by the attack on Iraq a few weeks earlier, but perhaps the most decisive factor in bringing the North Koreans to the table in Beijing was that the Chinese temporarily shut the spigot of the North’s primary supply of fuel oil. As for Iraq, the North Korean state news agency responded to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein by declaring that the lesson was clear: a nuclear weapon is the only way to keep the Americans at bay. Not surprisingly, the talks in Beijing in April broke down.
Washington’s appetite for a confrontation with Pyongyang soured over the summer, as success in Iraq proved elusive. Nevertheless, America’s relative inattention to North Korea may end up looking like a deliberate policy after all, along the lines of what Victor Cha, a scholar of Korean affairs at Georgetown University, has described as “hawkish engagement” or “coercive diplomacy”—a strategy that holds out the prospect of talks under a persuasive threat of action, such as severe sanctions, or an embargo backed by a blockade, to begin with, and, beyond that, the prospect of overwhelming force. The Bush Administration has refused to allow Kim Jong Il to dictate the terms of discussion, thus obliging his neighbors to take up the slack. When China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea agreed this summer to join the United States and North Korea in a new round of talks, the North had to recognize that it could no longer presume on anyone’s friendship, or count on playing off the key powers in its orbit against one another.
Even after the latest round of talks in Beijing, in August, there is no indication of how the gulf of mistrust between Washington and Pyongyang might be bridged, or which adversary might be more susceptible to the group pressure to blink. Mort Abramowitz, a former senior State Department official who recently co-chaired the Council on Foreign Relations task force on North Korea, said that while the Bush Administration may now be willing to cut a deal with Kim Jong Il, its over-all attitude so far has been: “You commit suicide and we’ll talk to you.” It is hard to believe, however, that Kim Jong Il will ever give up his nuclear capability. His weapons are all he has.
A Western diplomat in Seoul described Korea to me as “the peninsula of bad options.” We were talking about how the South’s position as a hostage to the North’s artillery makes it a wild card in any attempt to address the nuclear crisis. Public sentiment in the South—manifested in opinion polls and anti-American demonstrations—has often seemed to sympathize with Pyongyang’s complaint that it is the Bush Administration’s hawkishness that is disturbing Korea’s truce. This feeling, which is especially pronounced among South Koreans in their twenties and thirties, who have no memory of the Korean War, was exacerbated last year, following a road accident in which a U.S. Army vehicle struck and killed two South Korean girls. A Pew Research Center survey, released shortly before the multilateral talks began in Beijing at the end of August, found that South Koreans regard North Korea as a lesser danger to the region than do Australians, Americans, Germans, the British, and Canadians.
Horace H. Underwood, the executive director of the Fulbright program in South Korea, recalled his surprise on visiting the United States last Christmas to find stories about North Korea’s nuclear program on the front pages of newspapers “in vanishingly small places that never have international news.” In Seoul, he said, “nobody’s paying attention. They’re worried about a parking spot.” Underwood, who comes from a long line of Presbyterian missionaries in Korea—his father and grandfather were born there, and he has called Seoul home for most of his life—couldn’t decide whether the apathy about North Korea was a result of realism born of experience, or evidence of a naïve and defensively willed obliviousness. Another longtime American resident of Seoul said, “Underlying this is a strong sense of nationalism. Some people here feel an odd satisfaction when North Koreans launch a missile over Japan, or develop a nuclear weapon. You know, at least they can stand up for themselves.”
Despite initial reluctance, the South Korean government sent a contingent of noncombatant troops to join the American forces in Iraq this spring, but the government remains steadfastly neutral on the question of whether the North has nukes or is bluffing. “Some people in the Bush Administration wonder why South Koreans don’t take it a little more seriously,” a Western intelligence officer said to me. After a moment, he had his answer: “It’s like so much of their history—they’re pinned between more powerful surrounding powers, and they don’t know how to leverage their own interests. To be dependent for security on the foreigners their history has taught them to fear and suspect—I guess we have to pardon them if this makes them a bit schizophrenic.” Besides, he said, “they’ve been living with what we call threat denial for a long time, and you’re always more vulnerable when you’re not in touch with reality.”
What South Koreans fear more than the North’s weaponry is its economic weakness. After a brief spasm of sympathetic euphoria at the spectacle of the Berlin Wall being torn down, South Koreans watched German reunification with a sense of horror at the sheer cost to capitalist West Germany of merging with the post-Communist East. West Germany had far greater resources and greater political stability than South Korea, while the North’s needs were almost immeasurably greater than East Germany’s, and its population vastly more hapless. Indeed, South Koreans tend to view the three thousand North Korean defectors in their midst as a major social problem, perhaps because they represent a much larger possibility. “These are people who have been socialized for fifty years into a completely totalitarian culture, and all of a sudden they have to make choices about their lives and have no clue how to do it. Not a clue,” Wendy Sherman said. “Well, imagine twenty-three million people having to do that.”
Even before the Soviet empire’s collapse, the South’s dictators and the conservative governments that succeeded them were hardly in a rush to assume the costs of reunification that their rhetoric called for. By the mid-nineties, as the conviction took hold among Southerners that they simply couldn’t afford to absorb the wreck the North had become, it was easier to think of North Koreans as something less than the brothers they were always said to be, something more like distant bumpkin cousins. One wishful thought led to another: perhaps North Korea, in its weakened condition, shorn of its Cold War patrons, wasn’t such a threat anymore; perhaps it really wanted to change, too, and just needed a helping hand.
Kim Jong Il has cannily played the South’s fears to his advantage. He has reaped enormous financial and political support from the fact that, in 1987, after nearly forty years of dictatorial rule, South Korea made the transition to democracy, and the majority of its people now vote according to their pocketbooks. Never mind that South Korea’s constitution proclaims national reunification to be the absolute objective of the republic, and that “one Korea” implies the same sacred mission in the South as it does in the North: victory over the impostor regime occupying the other half of the country. For the past five years, under two successive administrations, Seoul has abandoned its long-standing antagonism toward Pyongyang, adopting instead a policy of engagement, aimed at propping up North Korea with aid and trade. In practice, this means maintaining the Kim dynasty and the division of the peninsula for the foreseeable future.
This “sunshine policy” was introduced in 1998 by Kim Dae Jung, who was elected President on a platform of peaceful coexistence with North Korea. D.J., as he is popularly known, had for much of the previous half century enjoyed a reputation as the most prominent domestic opponent of Seoul’s military dictators. Once in office, he promoted reconciliation as the stepping stone toward eventual reunification— perhaps in a generation or two. The key to this gradualist approach was economic incentives. As the North savored the benefits of its gentle opening, rail, road, and air links would punch through the DMZ; military de-escalation would follow; Pyongyang would recognize the rewards of market reforms, and perhaps even be enticed toward a relaxation of social control. That was the idea: to coax North Korea in a direction that would make it more like contemporary China, which has in the past decade replaced America as South Korea’s biggest trading partner, and which also has no desire to see Pyongyang collapse. (China does not want to be flooded with refugees, or to have American troops move up from South Korea to its border.)
The sunshine policy didn’t address human rights or democracy. Business came first, and to speak of anything more “sensitive” was considered tantamount to giving up the game before it began. While the ultimate aim of the sunshine policy might be a more secure Korea, its most immediate objective was to prove its own value by winning Kim Dae Jung the opportunity to create a spectacular and emotionally charged image of a new Korean order: a handshake with the North Korean leader. D.J. said that it was his lifelong dream to be the first South Korean leader to set foot on North Korean soil, and in June of 2000 a children’s choir sang “Our wish is unification” as he flew off to Pyongyang.
Kim Jong Il surprised Kim Dae Jung by venturing into public and greeting him at the airport. The Dear Leader, with his pompadour, short zippered jacket, and shades, presented himself as a puckish charmer, relaxed, courteous, statesmanly, the perfect host. (An astonishing number of South Koreans will tell you that Kim Jong Il is “cute.”) A brass band played; soldiers goose-stepped past bobbing red balloons; throngs of civilians, numbered in the hundreds of thousands, leaped and flailed, chanting their leader’s name. The two Kims were seen holding hands. D.J. released a message saying, “We are one people. We share the same fate. I love you all.”
Eleven million Korean families have been divided with the country at the thirty-eighth parallel, and the Southern delegation was permitted to bring along a few members of such families to meet with their relatives in the North. Scenes of these wailing, tearful, and painfully brief public reunions played over and over on South Korean TV, and the promise—periodically fulfilled since—of more and bigger reunions to come was held out as incontrovertible proof of the sunshine policy’s triumph.
To be sure, North Korean handlers blocked South Korean reporters from venturing out of their hotel to have a look around in their free time. But the two leaders concluded their talks with a joint declaration of agreement—to continue a high-level dialogue “to solve the question of the country’s reunification independently by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation responsible for it,” to exchange prisoners, and to promote economic development through “exchanges in all fields, social, cultural, sports, public health, environmental, and so on”—and the summit was celebrated in the international press. “There is no going back now,” the BBC announced. “The world’s last Stalinist state has embarked on the road to ending its isolation.”
At the summit’s farewell lunch, Kim Jong Il teased, “As far as drinking goes, I’m a better drinker than Kim Dae Jung.” As it turned out, he could afford to be: in order to make Kim Dae Jung’s dream come true, officers of South Korea’s giant Hyundai conglomerate, acting as the President’s surrogates, had secretly—and, under the South’s national-security laws, illegally—transferred a hundred million dollars of government money into Kim Jong Il’s coffers. Six months after the “two Kim summit,” Kim Dae Jung travelled to Oslo to collect a Nobel Peace Prize. By the time he left office, early this year, however, the truth had come out: D.J. had effectively bought the meeting and, Koreans now say, bought the prize. His subsequent disgrace is all he has to show for it—that, and a lot of cronies under criminal investigation. The chief of Hyundai’s operations in North Korea jumped out his office window to his death this summer rather than submit to further investigation.
But the sunshine policy lives on, albeit under the alias “peace and prosperity.” The phrase was coined by South Korea’s new President, Roh Moo Hyun, who was elected to succeed Kim last year. Roh, a former human-rights lawyer, is the first South Korean President to have made no mention in his inaugural address of the restoration of the Korean nation. “Our government does not emphasize unification,” one of his top foreign-policy advisers told me. “Our approach, our policy, is basically cautious in dealing with North Korea,” he said, “because North Korea’s future has a great impact on our economic prosperity and political stability—and, of course, security.”
Whether the South is more secure since abandoning its hostile stance toward the North is a matter of bitter debate. When Kim Dae Jung went to Pyongyang as a man of peace, he also went as a sort of conquering hero, operating on the assumption that the South had effectively won the Cold War in Korea and that its superior position allowed it to be magnanimous in hammering out the terms of the peace. But Kim Jong Il saw the South come knocking, laden with offerings, and recognized a supplicant pleading to be spared the burden of a pyrrhic victory. He opened the door, and was happy to let Kim Dae Jung claim the credit for doing so. By declaring that the sunshine policy was merely a gentler strategy for wearing him down and finishing him off, the South offered him no incentive to change his ways, but it did suggest a clear counter-strategy: keep threatening to close the door, keep playing hard to get, keep asking for more kindness and greater gentleness. No wonder the Dear Leader was in such a jovial mood at the summit; Kim Dae Jung had just thrown him a lifeline. In exchange for hollow gestures, Seoul was prepared to expend enormous amounts of political capital and hard cash. That suited Kim Jong Il’s understanding of proper inter-Korean exchange: the South gives and he takes. D.J. released dozens of political prisoners from the North, and Kim Jung Il sent back none. His attitude was: we’ll see who’s surrendering.
To pursue the sort of policy that Roh’s adviser described requires avoiding confrontation, regardless of Pyongyang’s provocations, and above all indulging Kim Jong Il’s hypersensitivity in the ultimate charade of East Asian politics: the saving of face. In mid-April, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights passed a resolution calling on Pyongyang to give full access to international investigators so that they could follow up reports of such systemic abuses as torture, public executions, forced-labor camps, “all-pervasive and severe restrictions on the freedoms of thought, conscience, religion, opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and association and on access of everyone to information, and limitations imposed on every person who wishes to move freely within the country and travel abroad,” as well as “the mistreatment of and discrimination against disabled children.” It was the first time the U.N. had addressed North Korea’s human-rights abuses so formally and explicitly, and although South Korea had a seat on the commission, it did not vote for the resolution, or even abstain. South Korea simply didn’t show up.
“It’s just nonsensical—it’s incomprehensible,” Kang Chol-hwan, a North Korean defector, said to me when we met in Seoul a few weeks later. Kang, the grandson of a devout Party loyalist, lived in comfort in Pyongyang as a little boy. He had adored Kim Il Sung. But in 1977, when he was nine years old, he and his family were purged and trucked off to the Yodok prison camp. Kang has written a memoir of his captivity, “The Aquariums of Pyongyang,” and he still isn’t sure why they were sent there or why, after ten years, they were released. In his book, he describes with something of Primo Levi’s quiet authority how the brutality of the gulag is the ultimate refinement of the North Korean system.
Kang, who now works as a newspaper reporter in the South, regarded both the fanfare of the sunshine policy and the caution of Roh Moo Hyun’s peace-and-prosperity approach to the North as hopelessly naïve, and as something worse than appeasement, more like capitulation. If the issue is protecting the South’s pocketbook, he said, then what about the South Korean stock market’s five-per-cent plunge when North Korea admitted to having a nuclear-weapons program, and the enormous defense expenditures on both sides of the DMZ? “If you want to talk about the economy of reunification, talk also about the savings,” he said. “And if South Korea thinks of absorbing North Korea and modernizing it, it should speak not of helping and charity but, rather, of investment.” After the U.N. human-rights vote, he wondered, “Why doesn’t this government think about the situation it will face after unification when North Koreans ask why it didn’t care about human rights, even though it was suggested by the rest of the international community?”
Kang was incensed that the South had softened its rhetoric about Pyongyang at the peak of the North Korean famine, when the North was at its most vulnerable and could not have survived without support. Until 1997, South Korean broadcasts criticized Kim Jong Il. But now, Kang said, when there are more radios than ever entering North Korea from China, and “most people there are not sure whether their regime is right or not, whether Kim Jong Il can be believed and trusted or not,” the messages they hear from Seoul leave them wondering “if the South Korean government is really against them and pro-Kim Jong Il.” Kang was in despair at official shortsightedness. He wanted to see regime change in North Korea. “If the same situation happens in North Korea as Iraq,” he said, “then North Korea will collapse faster than Iraq, because in Iraq they have their Allah, but Kim Jong Il is a weaker self-made God.”
Before Kim Dae Jung went to Pyongyang in 2000, the only way a South Korean could get to spend time with Kim Jong Il was to be kidnapped at his order by his agents. In 1978, Shin Sang-ok, the South’s most famous movie director, was shoved into a car in Hong Kong, a burlap sack was placed over his head, and he was smuggled by ship to North Korea. His wife, Choe Eun-hui, a South Korean movie star, had been snatched a few weeks earlier. Shin spent the next five years in prison and reëducation camps. For a time, he survived on a diet of corn flour and grass. When he was released, he was presented to Kim Jong Il, a fanatical _cinéaste who keeps a library of fifteen thousand films and had for years been directing his own propaganda movies. Kim reunited the director with his wife, took him to a movie studio, and told him to get to work. Shin and Choe were both given a Mercedes-Benz; Shin was also given three million dollars a year to make films, and over the next three years—until the couple escaped during a trip to Vienna in 1986—he made seven features, including “Pulgasari,” a monster movie based on “Godzilla” that has become an international cult classic, and another movie that included North Korea’s first onscreen kiss. “The North Koreans were all talented and good people,” he told me when I visited his studio in Seoul. “Just two hundred or so were evil, and they were in charge.”
Shin, who is in his late seventies, cuts a dapper figure, lean and modishly tailored, with his hair swirled up from his high forehead in a shiny black wave. In North Korea, he was treated, following his release from prison, as a sort of royal pet and confidant. “Kim Jong Il was a young guy who knew only Communist Korea, who thought with money and power people would stay there. He thought money could fix anything,” Shin said, and added, “Kim Jong Il tries to understand capitalism only through movies. James Bond was a favorite, and he liked Rambo also, and ‘Friday the Thirteenth,’ and Hong Kong action movies. But he doesn’t know what fiction is. He looks at these movies as if they were records of reality.”
Still, Shin found Kim to be smart and funny. “He listened to me, because we were from South Korea,” Shin said. “Even though we criticized some things, he wanted us to be honest. Others would have been killed for speaking so honestly.” While Kim regarded Hollywood fantasies as documentaries, he sometimes let on that he recognized North Korea to be a realm of make-believe. “When Kim Jong Il let me meet my wife again after five years, there was a big party,” Shin said. “An all-male band played, then a second, all-female band came out, and the women band members cheered him. Kim Jong Il patted my hand and said, ‘That’s all fake.’ He knew the people didn’t respect him.” When Shin and his wife escaped from North Korea, they carried with them secretly made recordings of private conversations with Kim Jong Il. On the tapes, Kim readily acknowledges that North Korea’s brand of socialism is flawed; that its technology is at a “kindergarten level”; that its people lack enterprise and motivation because they are given none of the individual incentives that competition thrives on; and that anyone else in North Korea who said any of these things would be considered an ideological deviant, and purged.
Shin spoke bitterly of the years he had lost in the North, yet even as he described Kim Jong Il’s cynicism and called him an evil, controlling micromanager, most of his anger was reserved for Kim Dae Jung and Roh Moo Hyun’s rapprochement with Pyongyang. Shin has written a memoir of his kidnapping and sojourn in the North. It is titled “Our Escape Isn’t Over Yet,” because, he said, “South Korea is now sympathizing with North Korea, and it’s a dangerous situation.” It appalled him that the suffering of North Koreans, which he had shared in prison camps, gets more attention in Washington than in Seoul. “The human-rights situation in North Korea is ignored by South Korea, but the Bush Administration cares about it,” he said. “In South Korea, poor people made some money, and they became blind.”
The price of Seoul’s efforts to save Kim Jong Il’s face is that bit by bit the South is losing its own. Shin believes that only a war could wake the South from its complacency and rescue it from disgrace. “People would go sane if Seoul was a little damaged,” he said. Few South Koreans share Shin’s enthusiasm for such a violent jolt, but a vocal minority has been increasingly successful in making the South’s adamant silence about the North’s human-rights record a source of embarrassment for proponents of peaceful coexistence.
Shin is at work on a bio-epic about Genghis Khan, a movie that from his gloss sounds as if it will be loaded with metaphors for Korea’s confused identity and contested loyalties. “Genghis Khan in the story doesn’t know who his father is, because his mother was kidnapped when she was pregnant, and so he always wonders who he is,” Shin said. “Then the same thing happens to his wife, and he doesn’t know who his son is. Then he decides to unify his country. There’s a lot of action and violence.” He also said, “The story is very fun.”
One of the masterworks of modern Korean literature is a historical novel called “The Poet,” by Yi Mun-yol, which tells the life of Kim Pyong-yon—better known as Kim Sakkat, Kim “the Hat”—a folk hero of the mid-nineteenth century, whose verse is still popular. The story begins when Kim is four. His grandfather, a royal administrator who was captured by a rebel band and joined its cause to save his life, has been recaptured by the King’s forces and sentenced to death as a traitor. Because the law extends such punishments over three generations, his sons and grandsons are also condemned. Kim and his brother survive in hiding, disguised as peasants, but the family is scattered and stripped of its noble standing. Even after they receive a royal pardon, the label “a traitor’s descendants” follows them as they move from place to place seeking refuge. Kim enters adulthood consumed by anger at the injustice of his situation, and longing to be restored to his former rank. When that proves impossible, he crowns himself with a conical bamboo hat of the sort that traditionally shadowed the faces of those in mourning, and becomes a solitary wanderer, and a poet.
Yi Mun-yol imagines his hero with a brooding tenderness that derives much of its power and fascination from the fact that his novel can be read not only as a fictionalized biography but as a fictionalized autobiography. Yi was born in Seoul, and he was three years old in 1950, when the North overran the city. Three months later, the Americans came through, and Yi’s father, an academic who had been jailed by the Japanese for his activities in the anti-colonial underground and had become a Communist, joined the People’s Army as it retreated across the thirty-eighth parallel, telling his family not to worry, he’d be back just as soon as the North won the war. Yi was one of five children, and when his father left, his mother took the family to stay with relatives in the rural southeast. “At that time, during the war and immediately afterward, people known to have family in the North were sometimes shot,” Yi told me when I visited him at his home, a sprawling compound in verdant hill country an hour from Seoul. His mother had preferred to keep moving, and during the next twelve years, until the government imposed a residency law that required South Koreans to register a fixed address, the family lived in at least seven different places. “We would move late at night,” Yi said, “and it was very disruptive and frightening for me.”
It didn’t help that several other members of Yi’s father’s family had gone North with him. Yi’s mother took in sewing and kept the family afloat by occasionally selling off parcels of ancestral land. For years, she clung to the belief that her husband would return, but Yi realized at an early age that it would be impossible for a man who had pledged his allegiance to Pyongyang to come back. “The armistice line had been drawn, the DMZ was in place, children were already being taught anti-Communist propaganda in school,” he said. So for Yi it was as it had been for Kim Sakkat. “I was taught in school that the Communists are bad, and my father had chosen to go with the Communists, so in a way I must be bad, too,” he said. “But on the other hand this felt wrong, because I must love my family and they couldn’t be bad.”
Yi is a stout man, with a big head and a great mop of hair flecked with gray. Since 1979, he has published twenty novels (many of them running to multiple volumes) and fifty short stories, and his work—about seventy volumes in all—has earned him high critical acclaim and fantastic sales. (In South Korea, a country of forty-eight million, he has sold twenty-five million books.) Still, Yi considers himself a man apart from the mainstream of Korean literature. The reason for this is not so much the painful legacy of his father’s defection to the North but, rather, that in his efforts to come to terms with the Korean predicament, and his place in it, Yi does not find much use for the dominant emotion of the nation’s cultural and political life, a condition known as han, which Koreans insist is uniquely Korean and has no proper equivalent in any foreign language.
The word han actually comes from the Chinese, and as Gary Rector, a writer and editor who lives in Seoul and is one of the few Americans ever to be naturalized as a Korean citizen, explained, “The Chinese character shows a heart and it shows a head that’s turned away.” Yi described han sentiment, somewhat dismissively, as “a peculiar mixture of tragedy and comedy,” and Rector, who was interpreting for me, elaborated: “Han is an anger and resentment that build up, and at the same time a feeling of frustration or a feeling of desires that are unfulfilled. So resentment, frustration, bitter longing are lumped together.” Other explicators stress han’s cumulative nature, the steady accretion of a pattern of lesser injuries into one large and abiding sense of woundedness. Humiliation is a key ingredient of han, which is where its ironic or comic side comes into play: the self-mockery of the self-loving who are all too aware of their weakness. It is touted as a keenly Korean emotion because it recognizes the contradictions of the Korean experience: traditionally, the intense nationalism and yearning for purity, so close to German ideas of volk, coupled with an overwhelming experience of victimhood, and, for the past fifty years, the bitter reality of national division.
Han at its tenderest is melancholic and wistful, and in its darker forms militant and vengeful; in either case it is freighted with dissatisfaction and the temptations of extremism. Yi, who describes himself as “basically apolitical,” prefers to acknowledge that “there’s always a kind of duality to our existence.” Nevertheless, as he grew up grappling with the burden of his patrimony, he could not find a way to balance the competing public and private claims on his allegiance.
When he was fifteen, Yi heard from defectors that his father had been purged. He had last been seen in 1954, a year in which Kim Il Sung was thinning the ranks of the Southern Labor Party, and it seemed certain that he had been killed or sent to a camp to die. “For me that resolved the issue,” Yi said. He had been reading about Communism, trying unsuccessfully to grasp its attraction for his father. The more he read, the more he came to accept the government line in the South, that Communism was an impossible choice. Learning that his father had been purged, and could be assumed to be dead, only confirmed this view. “That doesn’t mean that I gave up on my father, or no longer thought of him,” he said. The news brought relief, allowing Yi to think of his father as a man who had made a mistake, and only discovered it in the worst way.
Then, in the mid-eighties, Yi received a letter from his father, who had spent thirty years in prison camps. He said he recognized at once that the “letter was written by force”—dictated “by some government official telling him what to say: convince your son not to write any pro-American stuff and so on”—and much later he was able to confirm this impression. The letter mentioned that his father had a second family in the North, another brood of five children. Yi had no way to reply, even if he had wanted to. He could only imagine the lives of his half brothers and half sisters, and in 1994 he published a novella called “An Appointment with My Brother.” Writing in the first person, Yi describes a journey to China’s northeast, where the narrator of the story goes to meet his father. The Korean-Chinese intermediary he has hired to enter North Korea returns with the news that his father has died, and offers instead to produce one of his sons.
They meet in the morning, at the narrator’s hotel, with an instant shock of familial recognition, and at first their encounter is charged with “the inborn antagonism that exists between half-brothers.” Each seeks to assert his primacy in his father’s affections, and also his self-sufficiency as an adult. A current of North-South friction runs through the barbs. The narrator boasts about his wealth, and his brother expresses disdain for it as evidence of dependency on America. Both men revert to caricatures of their positions, exaggerating their personal and social credentials. Although the sparring soon fades, the stiffness persists when they head off to the banks of the Tumen River to face North Korea and perform the traditional Confucian commemorative rites for their father. By the time they part, they do so amicably, but the narrator drinks heavily into the evening, and shortly after he returns to his hotel room, his brother, also drunk, knocks on the door and asks to come in.
“How I hated you and envied you,” he says, and he recalls how his family was restricted at every step, barred from advancement, denied admission to the better schools, held back in the Army. “It was because of the blood relations Father had in the South,” he says, adding, “You and your family were to us not so much human beings as an invisible curse.” The narrator is stunned: “It was such a curious reversal. What I stood for to my brother was exactly what my father stood for to me in the days of my unfortunate youth.” His brother goes on, reciting the hardships of life in the North, and telling of their father’s agony on his deathbed because there was no money left to buy painkillers. The narrator muses, “My dear brother, please stop. You have to live under that system for some time yet. If you can’t get shoes that fit you, you have to make your feet fit your shoes. Of course it’s best to find shoes that fit your feet, but that is not always possible for everyone. The shoe shops of history are always run by unskilled shoemakers.”
There is no moral to Yi’s story, only the awareness that this is what Korea has come to: half brothers, living in their respective half countries, who have inherited a situation that neither one wants and that weakens them both, and binds them by keeping them apart.
“It’s a situation that has to be improved,” Yi said. But it worried him that the South was laying itself open, while the North remained a clenched fist. “It’s like the old fight between the sun and the wind—there’s a Korean tale about which one can make the wanderer take off his clothes.” Yi’s “Korean tale” was Aesop’s fable. “The sun does it by trying to heat him up, and the wind does it by trying to blow the clothes off. Of course, if the sun is going to win, the traveller mustn’t know that that’s the sun’s purpose. The traveller must simply take off his clothes. But in South Korea we have told them, Now we’re going to shine our light on you guys and be nice to you in order to make you open to us. They’re not going to open up. They’re going to take advantage of whatever you offer them, and that’s it. What I’m concerned about is that they’re not the ones who are taking off their clothes—we’re the ones who are taking off our clothes.”
